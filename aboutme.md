# hi, i'm 5gdw
hi, i'm just some random idiot lurking around the internet, i probably won't be that active here, you'll most likely see me on discord or youtube

i do games and coding, i'll most likely code python and html, and for games i'm mainly on minecraft, if you ever want a chance of seeing me in minecraft here's some things you need to know:
- edition: java
- version: 1.12.2

so yea you can check out anything i post here but you might not see much because again, i probably won't be that active here, anyways if you ever want to contact me you can here:
